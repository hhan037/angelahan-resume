        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Angela Han, and I am a pursuing graphic designer. I live in California and currently attending University of California, Riverside as an undergrad student. I have attended art classes and digital art classes to extend my knowledge to pursue as a graphic designer. I am well rounded with my art background and took all of the art APs that were granted at my high school. The APs that I have taken were drawing, 2D, and 3D. I mainly design music album covers as practice to experiment and to add into my portfolio. Even though I started out wanting to do illustration, graphic design has caught my eye and the minimalist aesthetic was one of the reasons why I am now leaning towards this career.  I have a good understanding of the concept of the design and was granted many opportunities to work at a company over the summer.
 <br><br>

        Some job experience that I have was being a teaching assistant at an art studio for elementary school students and taught them the basics of drawing and painting. I taught them the basics of perspective of still lives and proportions of each object and help them understand the concept as simple as I can. Then we move on with painting, and this is when I teach my students color study, which is how each color is made and what secondary and complimentary colors are.  Everyday I would look over the students and guide them through the process of drawing and painting step by step. This job has given me experience of being a teacher and a leader. Another job that I also worked as was a cashier at Habit. A job as a cashier helped me teach ways to professionally handle customers and ways to please my customers as best as I can. This job is crucial to me because handling customers/clients is the most important thing for a graphic designer if I want to work in a company. <br><br>

        There are many hobbies that I like to do. I love to watch cartoons because this helps me admire each drawing, animations, and designs. This gives me motivation to be better and work even harder. I also admire and study logos to have a better grasp on designs and what attracts people. Another hobby that I like to do is to sketch. Sketching gives me a sense of calmness because it is where I can go wild with my imaginations and practice designs within my sketchbook. It is some sort of a fantasy land where I can do anything I want. I have an instagram page that is dedicated to my art and currently showing the progress of my portfolio. Instagram is my big motivation because it shows me the different artists that show their work and get inspiration from their artwork. The purpose of me wanting to become a graphic designer is to want people to admire my work like how I admire other artists' work and I want to captivate my customers with my design.
